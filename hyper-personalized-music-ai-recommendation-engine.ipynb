recommendations.\n\nFor this project, I decided to focus on a single user because it includes looking back at around four years of their listening history, which should achieve a greater degree of personalization.\n\nMany Generative AI interactions and experiences remain too generic to truly astound a user but a promise of this technology is a level of hyper personalization not previously possible at scale.\n\nThe long context window allows us to capture a great snapshot of a single user, before asking questions and interacting with a model.\n\nThis step in the right direction towards hyper personalization can be scaled to millions of users, with long context windows, the right datasets and caching.\n\nOur taste in music is a deeply personal and unique experience, which is why I

and refer to cached tokens in subsequent requests, which can result in lower costs, as cached tokens are charged at a lower rate. \n\nContext caching is well suited to scenarios where a substantial initial context (SavageCore's listening history) is referenced repeatedly by shorter requests, this is exactly what we're going to be doing when asking Gemini questions or asking for recommendations specific to SavageCore.\n\nWhen you cache tokens, you can choose how long they exist before auto deletion. Default is one hour but I have extended it to two hours to ensure queries do not time out for this Notebook. The Time To Live (TTL) is therefore set to 120 minutes below.

You listen to artists like Aphex Twin, Burial, and Boards of Canada, suggesting a preference for ambient, IDM, and experimental electronic music. Your appreciation for artists like The Chemical Brothers and Justice indicates a taste for dance-oriented electronic music, but your broader listening suggests you don't shy away from the less commercially-driven aspects of the genre.\n\n**You enjoy exploring darker and heavier moods:** Your listening history suggests you aren't afraid of darker and more introspective themes. You listen to artists like Lorn and The Toxic Avenger, who are known for their industrial, synthwave, and dark ambient sounds. This could indicate you appreciate music that explores challenging emotions or themes.\n\n**You have a diverse taste:** You don't limit yourself to just one genre, and you enjoy a variety of artists from different musical backgrounds. This shows openness and willingness to explore new things. You listen to reggae, hip-hop, rock, and even classical music, suggesting a wide-ranging appreciation for different styles.\n\n**You may be a creative person:**  Your interest in a variety of sounds, especially experimental electronic music, can sometimes be linked to creative individuals. They might appreciate music that evokes a sense of exploration and pushes boundaries.\n\n**You might be someone who enjoys the \"underground\" or less mainstream music:** Your interest in artists like The Bug, Digital Mystikz, and Loefah suggests an appreciation for music that isn't as commercially popular or mainstream. \n\n**You might be a fan of soundtracks:** The presence of music from video game soundtracks like *Grand Theft Auto* and *Job Simulator* hints at a potential appreciation for music that creates atmosphere and enhances a visual experience. \n\n**You may be a fan of certain subcultures:** Your interest in certain genres like dubstep and rave culture suggests an appreciation for the sounds and aesthetics associated with those subcultures. \n\n**This is just a guess**,  and it is important to remember that your listening history is just one piece of the puzzle.

You listen to artists like Aphex Twin, Burial, and Boards of Canada, suggesting a preference for ambient, IDM, and experimental electronic music.

You listen to artists like Lorn and The Toxic Avenger, who are known for their industrial, synthwave, and dark ambient sounds. This could indicate you appreciate music that explores challenging emotions or themes.\n\n**You have a diverse taste:** You don't limit yourself to just one genre, and you enjoy a variety of artists from different musical backgrounds.

This shared eclecticism suggests a strong foundation for compatible listening experiences. \n* **Shared Love for the \"Underground\":** SavageCore's interest in less mainstream electronic music and BeSpont's appreciation for alternative and indie rock suggest a similar preference for exploring music outside the mainstream.\n* **Exploration of Moods:** Both profiles seem to enjoy music that explores darker themes and more complex structures, indicating a shared appreciation for music that goes beyond superficial entertainment.\n\n**2. Compatibility Scores:**\n\n* **BeSpont:**  **85%**  \n* **gw666:** **65%**\n\n**Explanation of Scores:**\n\n* **BeSpont:**  The high score is due to the significant overlap in genre preferences and the shared love for diverse, explorative, and sometimes darker music. \n* **gw666:**  While both profiles have a strong interest in metal, the lower score reflects less overlap in other genres.  SavageCore's interest in electronic music, ambient sounds, and indie rock is less prevalent in gw666's listening history.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBeSpont and SavageCore appear to be the most musically compatible due to their shared eclecticism, appreciation for \"underground\" music, and shared interest in exploring different moods and experiences through music. gw666, while sharing a love for metal, has a slightly less diverse and overlapping taste profile compared to SavageCore. \n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":63},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Listen to a Song and Recommend a User","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Markdown, display\n\nfile_path = \"/kaggle/input/paphos-mp3/paphos.mp3\"\n\nmyfile = genai.upload_file(file_path)\n\nmodel = genai.GenerativeModel(\"gemini-1.5-flash\")\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\nPlease review three user music profiles:\n- SavageCore: {savage_core_profile}\n- gw666: {gw_profile}\n- BeSpont: {bespont_profile}\n\nTask:\n1.

Based on this, the user most likely to enjoy it is **BeSpont**.\n\nHere's why:\n\nBeSpont's profile clearly demonstrates a strong preference for heavy and progressive rock, specifically mentioning bands like YOB, Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin, Sleep, and Dozer – all of which share stylistic similarities with the uploaded track.  The song's heavy, distorted guitars, slow tempo, and atmospheric textures align perfectly with BeSpont's stated appreciation for \"darker themes, introspective lyrics, and powerful instrumentals.\"  Furthermore, the song's atmospheric and somewhat melancholic nature fits within BeSpont's expressed liking of post-metal and atmospheric rock acts like God Is An Astronaut, Khemmis, and Windhand.  The song's overall \"underground\" feel also fits BeSpont's apparent interest in less mainstream music.\n\nWhile gw666 also enjoys heavy music, their profile focuses more broadly on various metal subgenres, and their taste also extends to alternative and post-rock,  which don't entirely capture the specific heaviness and atmospheric doom elements of the uploaded song.  SavageCore, with their eclectic and experimental tastes, might appreciate *some* aspects of the song, but the song's primarily heavy and atmospheric nature would likely resonate less strongly with their preference for diverse electronic music and less overtly \"heavy\" sounds.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":64},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Personalization With Multiple Users\n\nWhen I introduce new users, its easy to see how impactful this level of personalization can be. \n\nI'm able to look at which users have more compatible music tastes, that could be used to facilitate real world interactions - such as attending a concert together, or create a group with shared musical interests. \n\nThere's also the question of dating versus friendship. Music taste can be a fun icebreaker for an initial conversation or coming up with first date ideas, online dating profiles often include music and genres a person listens to but not profile matching based on listening histories and music compatibility that could be an intersting path of further exploration. \n\nI'm also able to ask Gemini to listen to a [song](https://www.premiumbeat.com/royalty-free-music-genre/dance-techno\n) I've uploaded, describe the song and then from the musical profiles pick out a user who is likely to be most interested in that song. This is a audio recommendation system, where new songs we're likely to enjoy can be found for us.\n\nMusic is a great way to connect with other people and Gemini can help to facilitate more of those interactions, who knows who you might meet and the memories you could create!\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion & Further Research\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo conclude, this project explored how Gemini's long context window and caching, can enable hyper personalized user experiences, through music analytics, recommendations and user matching.\n\nI was able to introduce the listening history of three users and generate unique musical profiles for each. I was able to create an opportunity to bring two users together based on music compatibility that could facilitate real world music experiences.\n\nThis project is uniquely suited to a large context window and caching, as it allows us to bring in a significant period of listening history as context to then provide hyper personalized recommendations and suggestions. \n\nNo project is perfect and there were limitations and areas that would be great to explore further. \n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe dataset only contained song names, artist names and when it was listened to. There are a number of other data points that could improve Gemini's understanding of how our user listens to music, such as: how long the song was listened to, where it was listened to as a few examples. \n\nI was only able to access Flash consistently for this project, which limited to token window to 1 million tokens. As the largest listening history was around 700K tokens, this did not impact the project to much and I was able to take advantage of caching, clearing caches and saving to variables to utilize multiple user's listening histories.\n\nNewer features proved problematic, such as grounded responses with Google and image generation through Imagen. An example where I would have used grounded responses is once my musical profiles were matched, searching for an upcoming relevant concert for them to attend and accurate pricing using Google search data. Image generation is less problematic, as it could be used for an interactive game, generating an image based on a musical profile, but not as valuable a use case as facilitating a real world experince through grounding. \n\nA lack of grounding can impact the quality of outputs. Occassionally prompts have to be re-run to get a perfect output for every prompt. I spent time crafting my prompts and I could have used multi shot prompting but it requires at least 100K tokens to see performance improvements and I wanted to utilize listening histories, whilst keeping in 1 million token window. \n\n**Further Research**\n\nI primarily used text based prompting but communication and music is multimodal. I started exploring audio and it returned interesting results but there's a lot of opportunity to explore image, video and audio when it comes to understanding music. \n\nStructured outputs is an interseting topic here because I can generate recommendations or songs in a structured format that could communicate GET a song from an API. Looking at Soundcloud, Spotify, Apple Music and other popular music providers API documentation could reveal opportunities to utilize outputs automatically e.g. our Synthwave playlist we created based on our listening history with a list of songs and artists. \n\nArmed with music profiles, it would be interesting to learn more about whether music is truly a great way to find and meet new friends or romantic partners, by using our unique music personalities to match with other users and create real world interactions. \n\nWhether the hyper personalized recommendations help marketing teams to serve relevant advertisements and do those tailored advertisments convert more frequently, upcoming concerts, albums, songs that our user should be interested in. Linking outputs to concrete outcomes requires more exploration. ","metadata":{}}]}
